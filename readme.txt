In this game there are two(at leat two) fractions, that are going to fight for territory. There is always a commander unit, which is being created first. If it dies - u loose. Every fraction has similar units by type, but they are compeletely different with their power, cost and etc. Your goal is to lead your army in right way. The problem is that u can't create anything at any time, for every new thing u have to pay some amount of energy, that is why energy generators are really important in this game.
